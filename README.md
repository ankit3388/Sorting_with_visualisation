# Sorting Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performance.

This helps one to visualize a sorting algorithm. Each element of the array is displayed as a bar. The operations are colour coded such that: 

1. Red - Swap
2. Blue - Comparison 
3. Green - Element is in sorted position

It compares the time taken by the different algorithm for sorting the array.

# Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch the sorting process in real-time with a visually appealing representation of the elements being sorted.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different paces.
Customizable Array Size: Set the size of the input array to visualize sorting with different data sizes.
Step-by-Step Explanation: Get a detailed step-by-step explanation of the sorting algorithm's progress during the visualization.
Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
